    question: 'What is EcoVeridian?',
    answer:
      "EcoVeridian is a browser extension and platform that generates comprehensive environmental risk reports for companies. By scanning recent news articles and independent reports, we provide a GreenScore (0-100) that indicates a company's environmental risk level. Our dashboard lets you track all your analyzed companies, view detailed reports with key articles, event breakdowns, and actionable insights to help you make more informed, sustainability-conscious decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How is the sustainability score calculated?',
    answer:
      'Our GreenScore (0-100) is calculated using a 6-factor model that analyzes recent, independent news articles and reports about a company. The algorithm weighs each event based on severity, credibility of the source, recency, scope of impact, and confidence level. We use log compression to ensure no single event disproportionately skews the overall assessment. Higher scores indicate lower environmental risk. Each report shows the key articles that influenced the score, along with detailed metrics like impact, contribution percentage, and source credibility.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this an ESG rating?',
    answer:
      "While our analysis covers many topics found in traditional ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reports, our score is designed to be a more accessible, real-time snapshot based on a company's digital presence. It is a supplementary tool, not a replacement for official ESG ratings.",
  },
  {

    answer:
      'The EcoVeridian extension is available for all major browsers. This includes Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, and others that support Chrome extensions. We also fully support Mozilla Firefox. Safari support is planned for a future release.',
